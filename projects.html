        <h3><b><u>Java Projects: </u></b></h3>
        <br />
        <p>Most of my java projects are hosted on github, but I'll give a brief recap of them  here! You can visit them here: </p>

        <h5>Calculator: </h5>
        <br />
        <p>This project consists of a calculator and graphing calculator. There are many supporting classes to this, and the jar file is NOT executable. You can read documentations and write your own main method to test the files!</p>
        <br />
        <h5>Fractions: </h5>
        <br />
        <p>This project consists of two files that represent fractions and mixed numbers, and can be used to create instances of each other! Just like all other jar files in this repository, the jar file is NOT executable!</p>
        <br />
        <h5>Stats: </h5>
        <br />
        <p>Consisting of classes for statistics with arrays, lists, and combinatorics (permutations and combinations). The jar file is NOT executable!</p>
        <br />
        <h5>StringX (String Extender): </h5>
        <br />
        <p>Classes that turn strings into lists, remove whitespace from strings, do data with strings, and subtract strings (more like replace than subtract). The jar file, like the rest, is NOT executable.</p>
        <br />

    <button class="accordion" onclick="expAcc('py')">Python</button>
    <div class="panel" id="py">
        <h3><b><u>Python Projects: </u></b></h3>
        <br />
        <p>As for python projects, I really only have two. However, these projects are big, so there is much more depth to them, even though I don't have many projects.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>SourceCode Bot: </h5>
        <br />
        <p>I think you knew this was coming! SourceCode is my utility discord bot, and I am proud of it! As of writing, we have surpassed 2600 lines of code, plus multiple supporting files and systems that go along with it! It does a lot, and if you wish to learn about it more, visit the Discord Bot page of this website, or join SourceCode Support on discord (link in About Connections)</p>
        <h5>Influence: </h5>
        <br />
        <p>Now this I have not talked about. Influence is a package uploaded to PyPI that adds things to python that it doesn't already have. It is named influence because it is "influenced by java" but "coded in python". There is a lot that I have added to it, and I struggled and learned a lot along the way! To learn more, visit the PyPI page or Github Repository here: </p>

        <p>As of right now, I do not have any C / C++ projects, nor do I have a Github repository for said projects. I will update this part once I have a repository with my C / C++ projects</p>

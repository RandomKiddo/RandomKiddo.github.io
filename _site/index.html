    "body": "Hey there! My name is Neil. Here is a little bit about me (personally):I like video games a lot. Some of my favorites include: Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Mario Games, GTFO, and more!I enjoy photography a lot as well, including landscape photography, animal photography, and astrophotography! Using a Canon Powershot G7X Mark II and a Sony Alpha 6000 Mirrorless camera, I have photographed the following: Landscapes of Costa Rica and Hawai'i, the milky way galaxy, the stages of a total solar eclipse, animals like hummingbirds and sea turtles, and more!I like listening to music and playing music! I have been playing guitar since 2016 and bass guitar since 2018. I was also involved in my high school's Jazz Band for four years, and loved every second of it! I also played baritone/euphonium through middle school, and was involved in Ohio's District X Honor Band in 8th grade. I had the immense pleasure during my time as a euphonium player to take part in debuting two brand-new commissioned pieces! They were Wind of the Waves by Chris M. Bernotas (here) and Band of Heroes by Erika Svanoe (here)!I play sports in my free time as well! I play tennis, and have played it for several years, playing it through high school (on the high school team) and continuing in college as well! I also enjoy playing volleyball with my friends, and have recently gotten involved in playing in intramural beach and indoor teams! I plan on joining a summer league at some point as well. I am learning German. I have been learning German since 8th grade, and continued through high school, taking AP German. I continue to learn German to this day, pursuing a German minor in college, and I studied abroad in Dresden during the summer of 2024! In the future, I would also like to complete my fluency in Marathi (I can understand completely, but cannot speak or write very well). Programming is something I do in my spare time as well. I mainly program in Python, Java, Mathematica, and MATLAB. I also have the PCEP certification in Python and Wolfram U certifications for Mathematica! I am also involved with the AI Club at my university, and have completed multiple AI projects, and have competed in HackAI 2024 and 2025 (with the latter placing on the podium). I also have other programming-adjacent skills like LaTeX and Git. I like solving Rubik's cubes in my spare time, specifically speed-solving them. My current personal best for a 3x3 Rubik's cube is 10. 266s. I can consistently solve under 20s. I also like puzzle-solving in general, including solving 2x2, 4x4, 5x5, Skewb, Square-1, Pyraminx, and modded Rubik's cubes. Likewise, I also enjoy word games, sudoku, and more. Finally, I love reading and have multiple bookshelves full of books (3 and counting!). I read multiple genres, including sci-fi, fantasy, non-fiction, graphic novels, foreign language books, and more. I also enjoy watching YouTube and anime and playing/watching chess (casually)!Come to the jazz and band concert at 7! @olhsbands pic. twitter. com/KuzuDrMS9a &mdash; Mr. Kim (@MrKimOLHS) December 12, 2019Jazz Band Concert Practice 2019 (My Sophomore Year).

Below is a list of jargon terms and their explanations used on this page, for those interested:    AOX:  Average-of-X , i. e. AO5 is  average-of-5 . The average over how many solves.   OH:  One-handed , i. e. 3x3 OH is  3x3 one-handed .   Mains: The main speedcubes, or the go-to speedcubes, one uses for speedsolving.   Angstrom: A specific lubing and setup of a cube provided by thecubicle. com, aimed at control and stability.   M:  Magnetic , i. e. the Gan 354 M is the magnetic version of a Gan 354 (nowadays the M-version is the only version of a cube). Magnets in a magnetic cube are used for cube alignment, typically being drilled into the pieces themselves.   Ferrocore: Refers to a special core of a cube being made out of metal (typically iron or an iron alloy), adding weight and stability.   Mag-Lev:  Magnetic levitation . Unlike the magnets in a M-version cube, which are used for alignment and are on pieces, mag-lev systems replace the traditional springs in the core with repelling magnets, reducing friction and increasing smoothness. Thus, mag-lev systems and magnetic versions are not mutually exclusive; A cube can be magnetic only, mag-lev only (rare), or both.   Ortega, Reduction, Yau, Sarah's Method, Beginner's Method, 7-Simul Flip, etc. : These are all methods for solving different puzzles. These are typically named after their creator (Ortega, Yau, or Sarah's Method), or they indicate how a cube is solved (Reduction, Beginner's Method, or 7-Simul Flip).   CFOP, F2L, OLL, PLL: These are also methods for solving, specifically for n-by-n cubes, although most commonly used for 3x3 solving. CFOP stands for  Cross-F2L-OLL-PLL , with F2L standing for the first 2 layers, OLL for orientation of the last layer, and PLL for permutation of the last layer. Intuitive F2L indicates little or no algorithms are used when solving the first 2 layers, and thus done intuitively.   QiYi, MoYu, Gan, X-Man, LingAo, MFJS, YJ: All cube companies outside of the well-known  Rubik's .  Return to the About page. {% include footer. md %} "

    "body": "2025/02/23 -  Goals: Create a project for HackAI 2025 at OSU regarding AI docking port location and distance regression for the International Space Station.   Results: Utilizing the data, a multi-headed network (MHN) was built on the top layer of the MobileNetV3Small architecture. The MHN had three heads, each head regressing one of three values: the distance to the ISS, the x-coordinate of the docking port, or the y-coordinate of the docking port. After training, the best model was saved and then used to create a three-dimensional visualization showing the line the SpaceX Dragon capsule would need to take to dock with the ISS. An animation was made of this visualization. This visualization utilized public-access STL files of the ISS and Dragon capsule.  This project won 3rd place in the competition. Motivation: We wanted to create an open-source docking system that can be generalized for different spacecraft. This would aid in the flight process of docking capsules to space stations and would allow for astronauts to direct their attention to other aspects outside of docking. This project also allows for the generalization of docking, showing that it would be possible to do other similar docking tasks with the right data (i. e. , automated parking, ship docking, airplane-to-gate travel, etc. ) Data: The data is a set of 10,000 images of the ISS with labeled distance values and the location of docking port (albeit in a less-usable format). The data came from Kaggle. It was originally part of an AICrowd challenge. The Model: After tuning the model, we arrived on the following MHN top layer on the MobileNetV3Small architecture.  We trained the model for 50 epochs implementing early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks to stop the training early if the validation loss stopped decreasing (started to overfit), and to only save the best model based on validation loss. Since this was an MHN, we had three loss functions to minimize, one for each head. We chose MAE for all three heads because we are working with distances. The total loss of the model was a weighted sum of these three individual losses, the weights being tuned through trial-and-error. The result was the following loss graph: Visualization: Training the model yielded the best model to use for visualization and prediction. Utilizing public-access STL files of the ISS and SpaceX Dragon capsule, we were able to create a 3D visualization in python of the capsule and ISS in 3D-space, and the line the capsule needs to take to dock, using the predictions from the model. Using this visualization, we made an animation showcasing the results of the model. The animation is shown below.  See the full project on Github "

    "title": "Dementia Classification AI",
    "body": "2024/09/28 -  Goals: Revisit the project for OSU Hack AI 2024 and make the model not overfit.   Results: Stacked layers of 61 images of an MRI scan into 3D tensors and build a Tensorflow functional model and trained it using GPU acceleration with an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU for a test accuracy of 97. 31%. Motivation: We wanted to create a classification model that would be able to detect if a patient has dementia based on a set of 61 layers of an MRI scan. If successful, this model could be a support tool for doctors to detect if a patient has dementia. It may not be the definitive way to detect if a patient has dementia, but it could be helpful for doctors to see what the model thinks the patient has and with what confidence. Data: The data comes from the OASIS Alzheimer’s dataset, a public dataset consisting of 80,000 MRI images. Since 61 MRI images are for a single patient, it means we have over 1300 patients worth of data in this dataset. The data was downloaded from Kaggle, but can also be accessed through the OASIS website. The HackAI 2024 Model: As a part of the OSU AI Club Hack AI 2024, this project was selected by the team to try in complete in the 24-hour hackathon. We downsized the OASIS images and converted them to grayscale to decrease training time and complexity. We stacked each of the 61 MRI images per patient into a 3D tensor as a numpy ndarray and saved the patient’s 3D MRI scan as an . npz file. We then amplified some of the moderate dementia and mild dementia samples through duplication, as there weren’t many patients with that classification. We then created a Tensorflow functional model to train on the sample data. Although we had a good training accuracy, we had a relatively low testing accuracy (indicating overfitting). Unfortunately, due to not having access to a GPU at the hackathon, we could not GPU accelerate the model, and we did not have enough time to test a simpler model. The training accuracy was in the high 90% range, but the testing accuracy hovered around high 70%. Although this repository is being integrated with the Hack AI 2024 repository (meaning the files here will now also be there), the older version of the model can still be found by looking back in the commits here. This Model &amp; Results: We revisited this model to try and create a better model. We continued to use the stacked 3D tensors. The creation file for them is located in the npz_generation. py file. We created a simpler Tensorflow functional model and GPU accelerated with an NVIDIA RTX 3060 to decrease training time. We added training callbacks of ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping to save the best possible model. We got a training accuracy of 100% (it isn’t really 100%, it is being rounded) with a testing accuracy of 97. 31%, indicating that our model makes much better generalizations this time around.

Problem: A wheel with radius R has a constant angular velocity in the -z direction (so the wheel rolls in +x). There is a dot on the wheel a distance p away from the center where p&gt;0. We wish for R&gt;p, but we do explore when p&gt;R and even when p=R. We wish to animate the motion of this dot. Result: We go through many different results and iterations of animation. The entire process is on the Github tied to the project. This was the final result for R=2, angular velocity of -2, and p=1, and for values of p=2 and p=4. p=1: p=2: p=4: Note that the original project used a . mov file.

My personal work was on the development side, where I worked on server optimizations regarding instant block placement, world border creation, staff command logs, and moderator utility commands. Although my time on the project only spanned a couple months, I enjoyed the time I worked on the project. What is Spigot?:Minecraft is a video game made in Java (for non-console systems). Spigot is one of many server-hosting options for Minecraft, like Bukkit, Paper, Yatopia, and more. Spigot allows for programmers to create plugins that are loaded with the server as enhancements. Using Spigot’s API, more optimizations and customizability are available for developers. This project helped me learn how to organize many tasks into smaller projects, and taught me how to work with more complicated programming systems, like APIs, documentation, and Maven.

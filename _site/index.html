I enjoy photography a lot as well, especially astrophotography, landscape photography, and animal photography. I also like music a lot (both listening and playing), and I have been playing guitar since 2016 as well and bass guitar since 2018. I was involved in my high school's Jazz Band for all four years (and loved every second of it). I am currently learning German. Along with my major, I am currently pursuing a German minor and an Honors Math minor. In the future, I would love to learn a language with a different writing system (like Japanese). I love programming. I have programming skills in Python, C++, Java, and more! I have a certification in Python as well! I currently have been working on AI projects with AI Club on campus. I working towards getting a Tensorflow certification as well. I also have LaTeX skills and other programming-adjacent skills.

Drop all date and location information and ensure we are only working with numerical data for regression. Deal with null values accordingly, and then split the data into training and testing sets. Define a model that normalizes the data and then trains on 4 ReLU Dense layers of 512 filters with L2 Regularization, and then finish with a singular filter Dense layer.

Results: A model that is pretty close to the true values of the stock price range predicted (matches shape well, exact values not attained). Process: Collect csv data into a Pandas DataFrame. Enumerate the data to make it all numbers and then visualize the data to see what we’re working with. We then reshape and compile the closing price data and do the same to the high and low price values. We concatenate that usiny NumPy into one array and scale the data. We split the data into training and testing sets, and then using TensorFlow and Keras to generate a Sequential model with a LSTM and Dense layer. After compiling it and training it on the training set, we then predict the stock price closing value of the test set, and then graph the results to inspect the accuracy.

Enumerate the data to get a frame with only numbers. Check for unusable data and use imputation, if needed, to insert data. After inspecting graphs of the data, normalize the data and filter it accordingly. Split the data into training and test sets, and then model the data using KNeighborsRegressor model and train the data. Then, we predict on the test set and measure the error. Finally, we fiddle with the model a bit to find the most accurate one, and then we’re done.

My personal work was on the development side, where I worked on server optimizations regarding instant block placement, world border creation, staff command logs, and moderator utility commands. Although my time on the project only spanned a couple months, I enjoyed the time I worked on the project. What is Spigot?:Minecraft is a video game made in Java (for non-console systems). Spigot is one of many server-hosting options for Minecraft, like Bukkit, Paper, Yatopia, and more. Spigot allows for programmers to create plugins that are loaded with the server as enhancements. Using Spigot’s API, more optimizations and customizability are available for developers. This project helped me learn how to organize many tasks into smaller projects, and taught me how to work with more complicated programming systems, like APIs, documentation, and Maven.

Any developer can create a Discord Bot to add enhancements to the application, which can be fun things (like games) or more useful things (moderation abilities). Starting May 2020, I worked on a Discord Bot called Source Code. In the future, I worked on a larger bot called Psyduck. Both bots were for personal use only, and never became public verified Discord Bots. Through this project I learned a lot about Python development and asynchronous programming. Additionally, I learned about cloud hosting environments like Heroku and Google Cloud VM to host the bot 24/7. I worked a lot with JSON and SQLite as well to store important data. This project help fuel my love for computer science and also taught me how to handle a large-scale project. Screenshots: See an obscured version of one of my bots (Psyduck) on Github "

Hey there! My name is Neil. Here is a little bit about me (personally):

<ul>
<li>Pronouns: he/him/his</li>
<li>Hobbies: I like to play video games and I also play tennis and have been since around 2016. I enjoy photography a lot as well, especially astrophotography, landscape photography, and animal photography.</li>
<li>I also like music a lot (both listening and playing), and I have been playing guitar since 2016 as well and bass guitar since 2018. I was involved in my high school's Jazz Band for all four years (and loved every second of it).</li>
<li>I am currently learning German. Along with my major, I am currently pursuing a German minor and an Honors Math minor. In the future, I would love to learn a language with a different writing system (like Japanese).</li>
<li>I love programming. I have programming skills in Python, C++, Java, and more! I have a certification in Python as well! I currently have been working on AI projects with AI Club on campus. I working towards getting a Tensorflow certification as well. I also have LaTeX skills and other programming-adjacent skills.</li>
</ul>

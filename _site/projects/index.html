I enjoy photography a lot as well, especially astrophotography, landscape photography, and animal photography. I also like music a lot (both listening and playing), and I have been playing guitar since 2016 as well and bass guitar since 2018. I was involved in my high school's Jazz Band for all four years (and loved every second of it). I am currently learning German. Along with my major, I am currently pursuing a German minor and an Honors Math minor. In the future, I would love to learn a language with a different writing system (like Japanese). I love programming. I have programming skills in Python, C++, Java, and more! I have a certification in Python as well! I currently have been working on AI projects with AI Club on campus. I working towards getting a Tensorflow certification as well. I also have LaTeX skills and other programming-adjacent skills.

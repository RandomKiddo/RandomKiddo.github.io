    "body": "Hey there! My name is Neil. Here is a little bit about me (personally):I like video games a lot. Some of my favorites include: Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Mario Games, GTFO, and more!I enjoy photography a lot as well, including landscape photography, animal photography, and astrophotography! Using a Canon Powershot G7X Mark II and a Sony Alpha 6000 Mirrorless camera, I have photographed the following: Landscapes of Costa Rica and Hawai'i, the milky way galaxy, the stages of a total solar eclipse, animals like hummingbirds and sea turtles, and more!I like listening to music and playing music! I have been playing guitar since 2016 and bass guitar since 2018. I was also involved in my high school's Jazz Band for four years, and loved every second of it! I also played baritone/euphonium through middle school, and was involved in Ohio's District X Honor Band in 8th grade. I play sports in my free time as well! I play tennis, and have played it for several years, playing it through high school (on the high school team) and continuing in college as well! I also enjoy playing volleyball with my friends, and have recently gotten involved in playing in intramural beach and indoor teams! I plan on joining a summer league at some point as well. I am learning German. I have been learning German since 8th grade, and continued through high school, taking AP German. I continue to learn German to this day, pursuing a German minor in college, and I studied abroad in Dresden during the summer of 2024! In the future, I would also like to complete my fluency in Marathi (I can understand completely, but cannot speak or write very well). Programming is something I do in my spare time as well. I mainly program in Python, Java, Mathematica, and MATLAB. I also have the PCEP certification in Python and Wolfram U certifications for Mathematica! I am also involved with the AI Club at my university, and have completed multiple AI projects, and have competed in HackAI 2024. I also have other programming-adjacent skills like LaTeX and Git. I like solving Rubik's cubes in my spare time, specifically speed-solving them. My current personal best for a 3x3 Rubik's cube is 12. 56s. I can consistently solve under 20s. Finally, I love reading and have multiple bookshelves full of books. I also enjoy watching YouTube and anime and playing chess!Come to the jazz and band concert at 7! @olhsbands pic. twitter. com/KuzuDrMS9a &mdash; Mr. Kim (@MrKimOLHS) December 12, 2019Jazz Band Concert Practice 2019 (My Sophomore Year).

    "title": "Dementia Classification AI",
    "body": "2024/09/28 -  Goals: Revisit the project for OSU Hack AI 2024 and make the model not overfit.   Results: Stacked layers of 61 images of an MRI scan into 3D tensors and build a Tensorflow functional model and trained it using GPU acceleration with an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU for a test accuracy of 97. 31%. Motivation: We wanted to create a classification model that would be able to detect if a patient has dementia based on a set of 61 layers of an MRI scan. If successful, this model could be a support tool for doctors to detect if a patient has dementia. It may not be the definitive way to detect if a patient has dementia, but it could be helpful for doctors to see what the model thinks the patient has and with what confidence. Data: The data comes from the OASIS Alzheimer’s dataset, a public dataset consisting of 80,000 MRI images. Since 61 MRI images are for a single patient, it means we have over 1300 patients worth of data in this dataset. The data was downloaded from Kaggle, but can also be accessed through the OASIS website. The HackAI 2024 Model: As a part of the OSU AI Club Hack AI 2024, this project was selected by the team to try in complete in the 24-hour hackathon. We downsized the OASIS images and converted them to grayscale to decrease training time and complexity. We stacked each of the 61 MRI images per patient into a 3D tensor as a numpy ndarray and saved the patient’s 3D MRI scan as an . npz file. We then amplified some of the moderate dementia and mild dementia samples through duplication, as there weren’t many patients with that classification. We then created a Tensorflow functional model to train on the sample data. Although we had a good training accuracy, we had a relatively low testing accuracy (indicating overfitting). Unfortunately, due to not having access to a GPU at the hackathon, we could not GPU accelerate the model, and we did not have enough time to test a simpler model. The training accuracy was in the high 90% range, but the testing accuracy hovered around high 70%. Although this repository is being integrated with the Hack AI 2024 repository (meaning the files here will now also be there), the older version of the model can still be found by looking back in the commits here. This Model &amp; Results: We revisited this model to try and create a better model. We continued to use the stacked 3D tensors. The creation file for them is located in the npz_generation. py file. We created a simpler Tensorflow functional model and GPU accelerated with an NVIDIA RTX 3060 to decrease training time. We added training callbacks of ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping to save the best possible model. We got a training accuracy of 100% (it isn’t really 100%, it is being rounded) with a testing accuracy of 97. 31%, indicating that our model makes much better generalizations this time around.

  <u>Goals:</u> Revisit the project for OSU Hack AI 2024 and make the model not overfit.
  <br /> <br />
  <u>Results:</u> Stacked layers of 61 images of an MRI scan into 3D tensors and build a Tensorflow functional model and trained it using GPU acceleration with an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU for a test accuracy of 97.31%.
</div>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>We wanted to create a classification model that would be able to detect if a patient has dementia based on a set of 61 layers of an MRI scan. If successful, this model could be a support tool for doctors to detect if a patient has dementia. It may not be the definitive way to detect if a patient has dementia, but it could be helpful for doctors to see what the model thinks the patient has and with what confidence.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>

<p>The data comes from the OASIS Alzheimer’s dataset, a public dataset consisting of 80,000 MRI images. Since 61 MRI images are for a single patient, it means we have over 1300 patients worth of data in this dataset. The data was downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis">Kaggle</a>, but can also be accessed through the <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/">OASIS website</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-hackai-2024-model">The HackAI 2024 Model</h3>

<p>As a part of the OSU AI Club Hack AI 2024, this project was selected by the team to try in complete in the 24-hour hackathon. We downsized the OASIS images and converted them to grayscale to decrease training time and complexity. We stacked each of the 61 MRI images per patient into a 3D tensor as a numpy <code>ndarray</code> and saved the patient’s 3D MRI scan as an <code>.npz</code> file. We then amplified some of the moderate dementia and mild dementia samples through duplication, as there weren’t many patients with that classification. We then created a Tensorflow functional model to train on the sample data.</p>

<p>Although we had a good training accuracy, we had a relatively low testing accuracy (indicating overfitting). Unfortunately, due to not having access to a GPU at the hackathon, we could not GPU accelerate the model, and we did not have enough time to test a simpler model. The training accuracy was in the high 90% range, but the testing accuracy hovered around high 70%.</p>

<p>Although this repository is being integrated with the Hack AI 2024 repository (meaning the files here will now also be there), the older version of the model can still be found by looking back in the commits <a href="https://github.com/Nishanth-Kunchala/Hack_AI_2024">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="this-model--results">This Model &amp; Results</h3>

<p>We revisited this model to try and create a better model. We continued to use the stacked 3D tensors. The creation file for them is located in the <code>npz_generation.py</code> file.</p>

<p>We created a simpler Tensorflow functional model and GPU accelerated with an NVIDIA RTX 3060 to decrease training time. We added training callbacks of <code>ModelCheckpoint</code> and <code>EarlyStopping</code> to save the best possible model. We got a training accuracy of 100% (it isn’t really 100%, it is being rounded) with a testing accuracy of 97.31%, indicating that our model makes much better generalizations this time around.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>A wheel with radius R has a constant angular velocity in the -z direction (so the wheel rolls in +x). There is a dot on the wheel a distance p away from the center where p&gt;0. We wish for R&gt;p, but we do explore when p&gt;R and even when p=R. We wish to animate the motion of this dot.</p>

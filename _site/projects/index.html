Some of my favorites include: Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Mario Games, GTFO, and more!I enjoy photography a lot as well, including landscape photography, animal photography, and astrophotography! Using a Canon Powershot G7X Mark II and a Sony Alpha 5000 DSLR, I have photographed the following: Landscapes of Costa Rica and Hawai'i, the milky way galaxy, the stages of a total solar eclipse, animals like hummingbirds and sea turtles, and more!I like listening to music and playing music! I have been playing guitar since 2016 and bass guitar since 2018. I was also involved in my high school's Jazz Band for four years, and loved every second of it! I also played baritone/euphonium through middle school, and was involved in Ohio's District X Honor Band in 8th grade. I play sports in my free time as well! I play tennis, and have played it for several years, playing it through high school (on the high school team) and continuing in college as well! I also enjoy playing volleyball with my friends, and have recently gotten involved in playing in intramural beach and indoor teams! I plan on joining a summer league at some point as well. I am learning German. I have been learning German since 8th grade, and continued through high school, taking AP German. I continue to learn German to this day, pursuing a German minor in college, and I have plans to study abroad in Dresden in the summer of 2024! In the future, I would also like to complete my fluency in Marathi (I can understand completely, but cannot speak or write very well). Programming is something I do in my spare time as well. I mainly program in Python, Java, Mathematica, and MATLAB. I also have the PCEP certification in Python and Wolfram U certifications for Mathematica! I am also involved with the AI Club at my university, and have completed multiple AI projects, and have competed in HackAI 2024. I also have other programming-adjacent skills like LaTeX and Git. I like solving Rubik's cubes in my spare time, specifically speed-solving them. My current personal best for a 3x3 Rubik's cube is 12. 56s. I can consistently solve under 20s. Finally, I love reading and have multiple bookshelves full of books. I also enjoy watching YouTube and anime and playing chess!Come to the jazz and band concert at 7! @olhsbands pic. twitter. com/KuzuDrMS9a &mdash; Mr. Kim (@MrKimOLHS) December 12, 2019Jazz Band Concert Practice 2019 (My Sophomore Year).

My personal work was on the development side, where I worked on server optimizations regarding instant block placement, world border creation, staff command logs, and moderator utility commands. Although my time on the project only spanned a couple months, I enjoyed the time I worked on the project. What is Spigot?:Minecraft is a video game made in Java (for non-console systems). Spigot is one of many server-hosting options for Minecraft, like Bukkit, Paper, Yatopia, and more. Spigot allows for programmers to create plugins that are loaded with the server as enhancements. Using Spigot’s API, more optimizations and customizability are available for developers. This project helped me learn how to organize many tasks into smaller projects, and taught me how to work with more complicated programming systems, like APIs, documentation, and Maven.

  <u>Goals:</u> Revisit Scikit-Learn House Price predicition AI, and redo it with Tensorflow and excluding location data.
  <br /> <br />
  <u>Results:</u> Model with an r<sup>2</sup> of 0.9946 and is generalized compared to the previous one.
</div>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>

<p>Use Pandas to read a csv into a DataFrame. Drop all date and location information and ensure we are only working with numerical data for regression. Deal with null values accordingly, and then split the data into training and testing sets. Define a model that normalizes the data and then trains on 4 ReLU Dense layers of 512 filters with L2 Regularization, and then finish with a singular filter Dense layer. Train the model with a 0.001 learning rate Adam optimzer, using MAE loss. Train the model, and compare the predictions to the true values.</p>

      <div class="message">
  <u>Goals:</u> Learn about Neural Networks and RNNs. Get comfortable with Tensorflow. Predict Proctor &amp; Gamble Stock (closing) price.
  <br /> <br />
  <u>Results:</u> A model that is pretty close to the true values of the stock price range predicted (matches shape well, exact values not attained).
</div>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>

<p>Collect csv data into a Pandas DataFrame. Enumerate the data to make it all numbers and then visualize the data to see what we’re working with. We then reshape and compile the closing price data and do the same to the high and low price values. We concatenate that usiny NumPy into one array and scale the data. We split the data into training and testing sets, and then using TensorFlow and Keras to generate a Sequential model with a LSTM and Dense layer. After compiling it and training it on the training set, we then predict the stock price closing value of the test set, and then graph the results to inspect the accuracy.</p>

  <u>Goals:</u> Get accustomed to Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn, and simple regression AI modeling. Learn concepts such as normalization, imputation, enumeration, the foundations of CRISP-DM, and the basics of AI modeling. 
  <br /> <br />
  <u>Results:</u> Model with an r<sup>2</sup> of 0.9999968, but is not general to any house due to location data being factored into the model.
</div>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>

<p>Use Pandas to read a csv into a DataFrame. Enumerate the data to get a frame with only numbers. Check for unusable data and use imputation, if needed, to insert data. After inspecting graphs of the data, normalize the data and filter it accordingly. Split the data into training and test sets, and then model the data using KNeighborsRegressor model and train the data. Then, we predict on the test set and measure the error. Finally, we fiddle with the model a bit to find the most accurate one, and then we’re done.</p>

  <u>About:</u> Pandora PvP is a collection of Spigot Minecraft plugins for a designated modded Minecraft public server. The plugins ranged from economy, to utility, and moderation. My personal work was on the development side, where I worked on server optimizations regarding instant block placement, world border creation, staff command logs, and moderator utility commands. Although my time on the project only spanned a couple months, I enjoyed the time I worked on the project.
</div>

<p><em>What is Spigot?</em>:
Minecraft is a video game made in Java (for non-console systems). Spigot is one of many server-hosting options for Minecraft, like Bukkit, Paper, Yatopia, and more. Spigot allows for programmers to create plugins that are loaded with the server as enhancements. Using Spigot’s API, more optimizations and customizability are available for developers.</p>

<p>This project helped me learn how to organize many tasks into smaller projects, and taught me how to work with more complicated programming systems, like APIs, documentation, and Maven.</p>

  <u>About:</u> Discord is a messaging platform with many quality-of-life features. Any developer can create a Discord Bot to add enhancements to the application, which can be fun things (like games) or more useful things (moderation abilities). Starting May 2020, I worked on a Discord Bot called Source Code. In the future, I worked on a larger bot called Psyduck. Both bots were for personal use only, and never became public verified Discord Bots.
</div>

<p>Through this project I learned a lot about Python development and asynchronous programming. Additionally, I learned about cloud hosting environments like Heroku and Google Cloud VM to host the bot 24/7. I worked a lot with JSON and SQLite as well to store important data. This project help fuel my love for computer science and also taught me how to handle a large-scale project.</p>

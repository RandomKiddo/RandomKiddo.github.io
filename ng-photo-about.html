<font style="trebuchet ms" size="5">I really don't know where to start here, and honestly I really don't need to go far, as not many people will even see this. However, I will continue anyway. Hi, I run the NGPhoto website which is a compilation of photos and videos that I have taken. I currently use a Sony Î±6000 as my standard DSLR camera. I use other lenses, such as a zoom lens by Sony, or a low-light lens by Rokinon to take other types of photos. My secondary camera is an automatic camera called the Canon PowerShot G7X Mark II. I have a lot of fun taking photos, and I hope you have fun viewing them too!</font>

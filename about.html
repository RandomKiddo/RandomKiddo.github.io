    <h4><b><u>About Me:</u></b></h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Neil! I am an avid programmer, but I do other things!
      I play tennis, as I have been since 9 years old!
      I love photography, and I mainly take pictures of the night sky, landscapes, and animals!
      I also enjoy hiking, bicycling, and social interaction with friends through gaming and more!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>In terms of coding, here is my history:</p>
    <br />
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="container left">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Starting Off</h2>
          <p>First, I started learning Python when I was eight but had to stop due to school, so I never really learned it</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container right">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Middle School</h2>
          <p>Then, in middle school, I learned Scratch coding (if that counts)</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container left">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Around There</h2>
          <p>Also around that time I learned HTML & CSS (I know they are markup not programming languages) for web design, but quickly learned that I wasn't a huge fan. I did build this website using HTML & CSS though!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container right">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Starting High School</h2>
          <p>In 9th grade I took an Intro to Computer Science class and learned the basics of Java. Also, I was the master of that class :)</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container left">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>In Between</h2>
          <p>In between 9th and 10th grade I finished learning Python, and found it extremely useful!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container right">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>College Level</h2>
          <p>In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, and was the master of that class too! It was also my favorite class! I got a 5 on that AP test!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container left">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Discord Time</h2>
          <p>In the middle of 10th grade, I started coding SourceCode, my discord bot!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container right">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Language Cram</h2>
          <p>During the summer leading to my 11th grade year, I learned C and C++, both of which I enjoy. I also learned JavaScript, but didn't like it too much. I only use it today for things like this website.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container left">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>A Project With Friends</h2>
          <p>Around that time, a group of friends and I learned Swift (and some learned Python) to create a game. Unfortunately, we ended up ditching Swift and focusing on Python. So even though I know Swift, I have most likely forgotten it at this point</p>

      <div class="container right">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Current Day</h2>
          <p>Currently, I am learning and finishing the FORTRAN programming language. Also I have done a bit of competitive programming on HackerRank, and have gotten a few certificates from them!</p>

title: PG Stock Price Prediction RNN w/Tensorflow
---

<div class="message">
  Goals: Learn about Neural Networks and RNNs. Get comfortable with Tensorflow. Predict Proctor & Gamble Stock (closing) price.
  <br>
  Results: A model that is pretty close to the true values of the stock price range predicted (matches shape well, exact values not attained).

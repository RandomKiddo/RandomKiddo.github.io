title: Dot on Wheel Animation
---

<div class="message">
  <u>Goals:</u> Use Mathematica to create an animation of a dot on a wheel that is rolling at a constant angular velocity.
</div>

**Problem:**

A wheel with radius R has a constant angular velocity in the -z direction (so the wheel rolls in +x). There is a dot on the wheel a distance p away from the center where p>0. We wish for R>p, but we do explore when p>R and even when p=R. We wish to animate the motion of this dot. 

**Result:**

We go through many different results and iterations of animation. The entire process is on the Github tied to the project. This was the final result for R=2, angular velocity of -2, and p=1, and for values of p=2 and p=4.

p=1:

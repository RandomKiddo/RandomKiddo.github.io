title: Hemoglobin Binding Project
---

<div class="message">
  <u>Goals:</u> Use Jupyter Notebook, LaTeX, and a Matlab Kernel to do data fitting on experimental hemoglobin binding data. Curve fit different models to the data, including the "Non-Cooperative", Pauling, and Adair models. Run a Monte Carlo simulation on the Adair model, but use brute force for the "Non-Cooperative" and Pauling models. Learn how to derive the models using the grand partition function. Create a poster and present it in LaTeX. Part of Polaris Program at Ohio State.

  <u>Results: We see that experimentally that hemoglobin oxygen particles are cooperative to some extent. </u>

The landing page for my photography! (Sorry in advance if this page loads slowly; The photo files are big, and I didn't want to reduce their quality). For astrophotography relating to DSOs, see the <a href="/astrophotography/index.html">Astrophotography page</a>. 

This page contains my "critics picks" (a.k.a. the photos I thought were the best and have a lot of diversity). There are other special landing pages containing more photos from specific trips. The page to access these landing pages is currently *under construction*.

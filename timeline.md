This website is currently being completely overhauled. This website has been made in Jekyll/Hyde, among other website pagination tools. This website will be completely revamped, being build from React/Typescript/TailwindCSS/Next.js/NPM. Here is the rough timeline of the project, with an expected finish date of *March 2026*:

> As of January 22, 2026, the project status is ***on time***.

1. August 2025: Begin work on the project, map out the project and install and set up the React environment.
2. September 2025 - November 2025: Finish preliminary pages of the website, pending final additions.
3. December 2025: Finalize bugs and issues, finish final touches on main sections (projects, coursework, etc.).
4. January 2026: Add and complete special sections, including the blog and special about pages. Update for new projects. ***We are here***.
5. February 2026: Security checks, bug fixes, general QA tests. Push a beta version of the website alongside the Jekyll version.
6. March 2026: Full beta deployment with domain integration. Bye bye Jekyll!
